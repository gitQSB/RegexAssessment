Please find my regex assessment in this repo. I have also included a screenshot of commands used to run my script along with the expected output (i.e. 'python QuinnBlack_TekSysRegex.py').

Please note the script must be run from within the ’TekSystems Regex Evaluation - Quinn Black’ folder. 

Looking forward to discussing future opportunities at Caterpillar!

Best, Quinn
